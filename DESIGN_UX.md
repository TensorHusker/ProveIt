## Design Philosophy

### Core Tenets

1. **Accessibility is Fundamental, Not Retrofitted**
   - Multi-modal interaction is the architecture, not an add-on
   - Non-visual users are first-class users, not edge cases
   - Every feature must work without vision, without hearing, without precise motor control

2. **Geometry is Proof, Not Visualization**
   - Spatial configurations ARE mathematical arguments
   - Lines and points carry logical meaning, not just visual appeal
   - Construction becomes reasoning

3. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Beginners see simple, elegant interfaces
   - Experts access deep type-theoretic machinery
   - Complexity reveals itself only when needed

4. **Feel the Mathematics**
   - Haptic feedback for proof structure
   - Audio cues for logical relationships
   - Spatial audio for multi-dimensional concepts
   - Mathematics becomes embodied, not abstract

5. **Cognitive Augmentation**
   - The tool amplifies human reasoning
   - AI assists but doesn't replace human insight
   - Proof construction is collaborative human-AI dialogue

### Design Values

- **Clarity over Cleverness**: Simple, understandable interactions
- **Consistency**: Patterns repeat across all modes
- **Respect**: Trust user intelligence; provide power with safety
- **Delight**: Mathematical discovery should feel joyful
- **Inclusivity**: Everyone can prove theorems

## Multi-Modal Experience Design

### The Four Sensory Channels

ProveIt uses **simultaneous** multi-modal feedback, not sequential or optional alternatives.

#### 1. **Visual Channel**
- Syntax highlighting (type-aware colors)
- Proof tree visualization
- Geometric construction display
- Type error squiggles
- Success/error color coding

#### 2. **Audio Channel**
- Type checking sounds (success/failure tones)
- Theorem application confirmation
- Error notification sounds
- Ambient background for "working" vs "waiting"
- Voice synthesis for proof narration

#### 3. **Haptic Channel**
- Proof step confirmation (short pulse)
- Type error (harsh buzz)
- Subgoal completion (satisfying click)
- Proof completion (victory vibration pattern)
- Exploration feedback (subtle texture)

#### 4. **Spatial Audio Channel**
- Assumptions positioned left
- Goals positioned right
- Current focus centered
- Related theorems around periphery
- Dependencies create audio "threads"

### Cross-Modal Consistency

**Principle**: Same semantic event → Same relative experience across modes

Example: **Applying a tactic successfully**
- **Visual**: Green checkmark, tactic highlights, goal updates
- **Audio**: Rising musical tone (C to E)
- **Haptic**: Gentle pulse (100ms, medium intensity)
- **Spatial**: Sound moves from tactic palette to goal position

Example: **Type error**
- **Visual**: Red underline, error tooltip appears
- **Audio**: Descending tone (E to C) + error description narration
- **Haptic**: Harsh vibration (200ms, high intensity)
- **Spatial**: Error sound at location of mistake

---

## Proof Construction Workflows

### Workflow 1: Forward Reasoning

**Use Case**: Building up from known facts to conclusion

**Steps**:
1. State available assumptions
2. Apply implications to derive new facts
3. Combine facts until goal is reached

**UX Flow**:
```
proveit> assume H1 : A → B
proveit> assume H2 : A
proveit> apply H1 to H2
✓ Derived: B
proveit> goal_reached
✓ Proof complete
```

**Assistance**:
- Suggest applicable theorems based on assumptions
- Highlight assumptions that could combine
- Show "path to goal" if system can find it

### Workflow 2: Backward Reasoning

**Use Case**: Working backward from goal to assumptions

**Steps**:
1. State the goal to prove
2. System suggests tactics that could prove it
3. User applies tactic, generating subgoals
4. Recurse on subgoals

**UX Flow**:
```
proveit> goal ∀(n : Nat). Even n ∨ Odd n
System suggests: [intro, induction]
proveit> induction n
New goals:
  1. Even 0 ∨ Odd 0
  2. ∀n. (Even n ∨ Odd n) → (Even (S n) ∨ Odd (S n))
```

**Assistance**:
- Tactic suggestions ordered by likelihood
- Show goal simplification preview
- Estimate remaining proof complexity

### Workflow 3: Geometric Construction

**Use Case**: Proving via spatial relationships

**Steps**:
1. Place initial points (propositions)
2. Construct lines between points (implications)
3. Identify triangles, parallel lines (logical structures)
4. Apply geometric theorems
5. Extract formal proof from configuration

**UX Flow** (GUI):
1. Click to place point P (assumption: P)
2. Drag from P to Q to create line (implication: P → Q)
3. System highlights: "Triangle detected, suggests: modus ponens"
4. Accept suggestion → formal proof generated

**Assistance**:
- Snap to valid configurations
- Show "almost valid" constructions
- Animate proof extraction

### Workflow 4: Automatic Search

**Use Case**: Let AI find the proof

**Steps**:
1. State goal
2. Set search parameters (depth, timeout)
3. System explores proof space
4. Present found proof for review

**UX Flow**:
```
proveit> auto_search --depth 10 --timeout 30s
Searching... (15% explored, 3 promising paths)
✓ Proof found in 12.3s (depth 6)
Review proof? [y/n]
```

**Assistance**:
- Show search progress
- Allow interruption and steering
- Explain why this proof was chosen
- Offer alternative proofs if found

### Workflow 5: Collaborative Proving

**Use Case**: Multiple users working on same proof

**Steps**:
1. Share proof session via link
2. Users see real-time updates
3. Turn-based or simultaneous editing
4. Chat/voice for coordination

**UX Flow**:
- User A: Applies `intro`, creates subgoals
- User B: (sees update) Works on goal 2
- User A: Works on goal 1
- System: Merges when both complete
- Both: Celebrate proof completion together

- Dark/light mode parity

### Typography

**Font Stack**:
```
Code: "JetBrains Mono", "Fira Code", "Cascadia Code", monospace

---

## Audio Design System

### Sound Design Philosophy

**Inspiration**: Video game audio feedback (satisfying, informative)
**Constraint**: Minimal, not overwhelming
**Goal**: Mathematical operations feel tangible

### Core Sound Set

**Type Checking**:
- Success: Rising arpeggio (C-E-G, 200ms)
- Failure: Descending tone (E-C, 300ms) + buzz
- In Progress: Gentle pulsing hum

**Proof Operations**:
- Assumption added: Soft "place" sound (like placing a chess piece)
- Tactic applied: Musical chord matching tactic type
  - Structural tactics (intro, elim): Perfect fifth
  - Computational (reduce, normalize): Major third
  - Search (auto, rewrite): Minor chord progression
- Subgoal created: Split sound (one→many)
- Subgoal completed: Merge sound (many→one)
- Proof complete: Victory fanfare (brief, tasteful)

**Navigation**:
- Move through proof: Gentle tick
- Enter/exit context: Door sound (subtle)
- Scroll: Paper rustle
- Select: Soft click

### Spatial Audio

**3D Sound Field**:
- **Front**: Current goal
- **Behind**: Previous steps
- **Left**: Assumptions/context
- **Right**: Available tactics
- **Above**: Abstraction level increase
- **Below**: Concrete details

**Example**:
```
You're working on goal G.
- Assumption A1 sounds from your left
- Assumption A2 sounds from your left-front
- Applicable tactic T sounds from your right
- If you apply T, sound moves right→center as tactic acts on goal
- When complete, sound rises (indicating level-up in proof tree)
```

**Implementation**:
- HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) for headphones
- Multi-speaker support
- Distance attenuation for relevance
- Doppler effect for moving concepts

### Musical Harmony

**Proof Structure → Music**:
- Related concepts: Harmonious intervals
- Contradictions: Dissonant chords
- Proof progress: Rising melodic line
- Stuck/error: Descending chromatic line
- Complex structure: Rich harmony
- Simple structure: Pure tones

**Example Mapping**:
```
Proof of A → B → C:
- A: C note (root)
- A → B: C to E (major third, implication)
- B: E note (consequence)
- B → C: E to G (minor third, second implication)
- C: G note (final conclusion)
- Whole proof: C Major chord (consonance)
```

## Haptic Feedback Patterns

### Vocabulary of Touch

**Basic Patterns**:
- **Tap** (50ms, medium): Selection confirmed
- **Double-tap** (50ms, 50ms gap, 50ms): Toggle action
- **Pulse** (100ms, low→high→low): Processing
- **Buzz** (200ms, harsh): Error
- **Click** (20ms, sharp): Precise action
- **Rumble** (500ms, low frequency): Major event

**Compound Patterns**:
- **Success**: Tap + pause + tap (victory rhythm)
- **Failure**: Buzz + descending intensity
- **Progress**: Repeating pulses (faster = closer to goal)
- **Discovery**: Rising crescendo
- **Confusion**: Irregular vibrato (system uncertain)

### Tactile Semantics

**Proof Operations**:
- Apply intro: Gentle tap (adding assumption)
- Apply elim: Sharp click (removing wrapper)
- Rewrite: Smooth transition (transforming)
- Unfold: Expanding pulse (revealing definition)
- Compute: Rhythmic pulses (calculation in progress)

**Geometric Operations**:
- Place point: Single tap at stylus location
- Draw line: Vibration along drawn path
- Complete construction: Satisfying "snap" into place
- Invalid configuration: Harsh rejection buzz

### Force Feedback (Advanced Devices)

**Novint Falcon, haptic arms**:
- Resistance when approaching invalid configuration
- Attraction toward valid proof states
- Texture for different type structures
  - Smooth: Simple types
  - Rough: Complex types
  - Edges: Type boundaries
- Weight: Proof complexity (heavier = more steps)

## Spatial Audio Architecture

### 3D Proof Space

**Metaphor**: Proof is a landscape you navigate

**Spatial Mapping**:
```
         [Abstraction]
               ↑
               |
[Assumptions] ← + → [Tactics]
               |
               ↓
          [Details]
```

**Navigation Sounds**:
- Walk toward goal: Goal sound gets louder, clearer
- Walk toward assumption: Assumption voice becomes prominent
- Rise in abstraction: Sound becomes more ethereal, reverberant
- Descend to details: Sound becomes more crisp, dry

### Audio Scene Graph

**Proof Tree → Audio Scene**:
- Each proof node: Sound source in 3D space
- Edges: Audio connections (panning, filtering)
- Current focus: Center position
- Context: Ambient soundscape

**Example**:
```
Theorem: A ∧ B → B ∧ A

Audio scene:
- Assumption (A ∧ B): Low hum from left
- Goal (B ∧ A): Clear tone from front
- And-elimination tactic: Chime from right
- When applied: Sounds move and merge
```

### Distance and Relevance

**Audio Cues for Importance**:
- **Close/Loud**: Immediately relevant (current goal, nearby assumptions)
- **Distant/Quiet**: Contextual (parent goals, distant facts)
- **Moving closer**: Becoming more relevant
- **Fading away**: Completed/no longer needed

### Binaural Implementation

**Technical Approach**:
- Real-time HRTF convolution
- Head tracking (if available)
- Fallback to stereo panning
- Speaker array support (5.1, 7.1)

  The function 'double' expects a number, but you provided:
    "hello"

  Suggestion: Did you mean to call 'length "hello"' first?
```

### Error Message Principles

1. **Show, don't tell**: Visualize the problem
2. **Explain why**: Not just what's wrong
3. **Suggest fixes**: Possible solutions
4. **Teach**: Help user learn from mistakes
5. **Be kind**: Never blame the user

### Recovery Mechanisms

**Undo/Redo**:
- Granular: Each tactic application
- Branching: Create alternate proof paths
- Persistent: Survives crashes

**Auto-Save**:
- Every 30 seconds
- Before risky operations
- Cloud backup (opt-in)

**Proof Repair**:
- If library changes break proof, suggest fixes
- "Fix all" for mechanical updates
- Review changes before applying

## Conclusion

ProveIt is not just a proof assistant—it's a new way of experiencing mathematics. By combining:

- **Geometric intuition** (spatial reasoning)
- **Type-theoretic rigor** (SCTT foundations)
- **Multi-modal experience** (see, hear, feel mathematics)
- **Universal accessibility** (everyone can participate)

We create a tool that makes formal verification **joyful**, **inclusive**, and **powerful**.

This is mathematics you can **feel**. This is proof you can **experience**. This is reasoning **amplified** by AI but driven by human insight.

**ProveIt: Where proofs come alive.**
