  Spatial Config  ‚Üî Logical dependencies

DATA STRUCTURES:
  - Point: id, position (2D), proposition (Expr), type cache, label, audio/haptic
  - Line: id, from, to, proof_term, accessibility metadata
  - Construction: points map, lines map, target theorem, metadata
  - ConstructionGraph: handles DAG structure, cycle detection

VERIFICATION:
  - Cycle detection in proof graphs
  - Correspondence checking (geometry ‚Üî logic consistency)
