## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items

| Item | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Kan Operations | ⚠️ HIGH | Allocate best mathematician-programmer; budget 50% extra time |
| Sound Design | ⚠️ HIGH | Hire professional sound designer early; have fallback stock sounds |
| Spatial Audio | ⚠️ HIGH | Start with simple stereo panning; 3D is enhancement not blocker |
| Proof Bridge (Geometric) | ⚠️ HIGH | Extensive prototyping before implementation; focus on simple cases first |
| AI Proof Search | ⚠️ HIGH | Start rule-based; ML is phase 2; don't over-promise |
| Distributed Proving (Butterfly) | ⚠️ HIGH | Research prototype separate from main release; optional feature |

### Medium-Risk Items

- TUI framework integration (mitigation: ratatui is mature)
- Haptic device compatibility (mitigation: start with gamepads)
- Screen reader testing (mitigation: recruit testers early)
- GUI framework choice (mitigation: prototype both options)

### Low-Risk Items

- CLI commands, persistence, documentation
- Error messages, undo/redo
- Keyboard navigation
- Testing infrastructure

---

## Parallelization Strategy

### Two-Developer Team Optimal Split

**Developer 1: "Core Engine"**
- Weeks 1-3: Kan operations, tactics
- Month 1-3: Advanced tactics, performance
- Month 4-6: Audio system lead
- Month 7-9: TUI framework
- Month 10-12: GUI framework, geometric proofs

**Developer 2: "Experience & Quality"**
- Weeks 1-3: Error messages, examples, testing
- Month 1-3: Undo/redo, commands, documentation
- Month 4-6: Haptic system, keyboard navigation
- Month 7-9: Proof visualization, user testing
- Month 10-12: Geometric tooling, export

**Collaboration Points:**
- Weekly sync on architecture decisions
- Code review for critical path items
- Pair programming on high-risk features
- User testing sessions together

## User Feedback Strategy

### MVP 0.1 (Week 3)
- **Audience:** 5-10 type theory experts
- **Method:** Direct outreach, GitHub issues
- **Questions:**
  - Is the core type system sound?
  - Are tactics composable enough?
  - Is audio feedback helpful or annoying?

### v0.5 (Month 3)
- **Audience:** 20-30 graduate students
- **Method:** Survey, usage analytics (opt-in)
- **Questions:**
  - What features are missing?
  - What's most frustrating?
  - Would you use this for research?

### v0.8 (Month 6)
- **Audience:** 10+ accessibility users, 50+ general users
- **Method:** User interviews, screen recordings
- **Questions:**
  - (Blind users) Can you navigate proofs independently?
  - (All) Is multi-modal helpful or distracting?
  - (Educators) Would you use this in class?

### v1.0 (Month 9)
- **Audience:** 100+ users, public launch
- **Method:** In-app surveys, community forum
- **Questions:**
  - NPS (Net Promoter Score)
  - Feature prioritization vote
  - Bug reports & wishlist

### v1.5 (Month 12)
- **Audience:** Broader math community
- **Method:** Academic outreach, conferences
- **Questions:**
  - Would you switch from Coq/Lean?
  - What domains would benefit?
  - Research collaboration opportunities?

## Contingency Plans

### If Kan Operations Take Longer (Week 1-2)

**Symptom:** Mathematical complexity > estimated
**Response:**
- Extend Phase 0 by 1-2 weeks
- Bring in external type theory expert for review
- Focus on subset (comp + coe only; defer hcom/glue)
- **Impact:** Delays MVP 0.1 but protects correctness

### If Audio System Fails (Month 4)

**Symptom:** Can't achieve pleasant, informative sounds
**Response:**
- Fall back to simple beeps (functional but not delightful)
- Defer spatial audio to Phase 5
- Focus on haptic as primary multi-modal
- **Impact:** Weakens differentiator but preserves accessibility

### If Geometric Proof Bridge Is Too Hard (Month 11)

**Symptom:** Geometry ↔ Formal proof mapping intractable
**Response:**
- Simplify to one-way (geometry → proof only)
- Limit to specific proof patterns
- Make it a "proof generator" not live sync
- **Impact:** Still valuable but less innovative

### If User Adoption Is Slow (Month 9)

**Symptom:** < 50 users after v1.0 launch
**Response:**
- Double down on educational outreach
- Create YouTube tutorial series
- Present at conferences/meetups
- **Impact:** Delays community features; focus on quality
