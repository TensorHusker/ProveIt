- Two Claude Code GitHub Action workflows
- Git repository structure

### What Doesn't Exist (Yet)

- Tests
- Documentation beyond README
- Contributing guidelines
- Architecture documentation
- Examples or use cases

## Vision Analysis

### Core Concept (from README.md)
> "Geometric construction environment for accessible formal verification. Build proofs, verify systems, and compose neural networks through spatial reasoning."

This vision combines three innovative elements:

1. **Geometric/Spatial Interface**: Unlike text-based proof assistants, ProveIt proposes spatial reasoning
2. **Accessibility-First Design**: Explicitly targets blind, neurodivergent, and post-injury users
3. **Multi-Method Integration**: Supports type theory, category theory, and homotopy type theory

### Novel Aspects

**1. Accessibility + Formal Verification**
- First project explicitly designing formal verification for blind users
- Challenges conventional visual-heavy proof assistant UIs
- Requires innovative approach to "geometric construction" for screen readers

**2. Neural Network Composition via Formal Methods**
- Unusual combination of neural networks with formal verification
- Could enable verified AI systems
- "Spatial reasoning" for neural nets is unexplored territory

**3. Real-Time Verification**
- Most proof assistants are interactive but not "real-time"
- Suggests performance-critical verification
- May target embedded systems or safety-critical applications

## Technical Stack Indicators

### Planned Technology (from .gitignore)

**Primary Language: Rust**
- Evidence: Cargo, rustfmt, .rs files in gitignore
- Rationale: Memory safety aligns with verification goals
- Rust ecosystem has growing formal methods support

**Development Tools:**
- cargo mutants: Mutation testing for robustness
- RustRover/JetBrains: IDE support
- Standard Rust toolchain expected

**Missing Technology Decisions:**
- GUI framework (if any)
- Accessibility libraries (screen reader APIs, haptic feedback)
- Formal verification backend
- Graphics/geometry engine

## AI-Assisted Development Strategy

### GitHub Actions Integration

**1. Claude Code Review (claude-code-review.yml)**
- Triggers: PR opened or synchronized
- Reviews: code quality, bugs, performance, security, tests
- Uses repository CLAUDE.md for conventions (doesn't exist yet)
- Automated quality gate

**2. Claude Assistant (claude.yml)**
- Triggers: @claude mentions in issues/PRs/comments
- Provides on-demand AI assistance
- Can read CI results for PR context
- Collaborative development tool

**Strategic Value:**
- Reduces review burden on maintainers
- Educational for contributors
- Maintains code quality from day one
- Good for solo/small team projects

## Critical Gaps & Questions

### Architectural Unknowns

1. **How does "geometric construction" work for blind users?**
   - Novel UX problem
   - May require haptic feedback, audio cues, spatial audio
   - Could inspire new accessibility patterns

2. **What distinguishes this from existing proof assistants?**
   - Coq, Lean, Agda, Isabelle are mature
   - What unique value does ProveIt offer?
   - Need clear differentiation strategy

3. **How do multiple formal methods integrate?**
   - Type theory, category theory, homotopy are related but distinct
   - Does ProveIt translate between them?
   - Or provide unified framework?

4. **What does "compose neural networks through spatial reasoning" mean?**
   - Needs concrete examples
   - Is this about network architecture search?
   - Or formal verification of neural network properties?

### Implementation Challenges

**Accessibility:**
- Screen reader integration is complex
- Platform-specific APIs (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Testing requires accessibility expertise

**Formal Verification:**
- Deep mathematical complexity
- Requires theorem proving expertise
- Integration with existing proof libraries

**Real-Time Performance:**
- Formal verification is typically slow
- Real-time constraints are stringent
- May need incremental verification

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)

1. **Create Cargo.toml**
   - Establish Rust project structure
   - Define dependencies
   - Set up basic build

2. **Expand README.md**
   - Add concrete examples
   - Explain use cases
   - Show what makes ProveIt unique
   - Include "Why?" section

3. **Write ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Explain geometric construction model
   - Describe accessibility approach
   - Detail formal methods integration
   - Outline neural network verification

4. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Welcome contributors
   - Explain development setup
   - Define code style and conventions
   - Create CLAUDE.md referenced by workflow

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept

1. **Minimal Viable Feature**
   - Choose ONE compelling use case
   - Implement end-to-end
   - Demonstrate accessibility
   - Validate technical approach

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Recruit blind users for feedback
   - Test with actual screen readers
   - Iterate on UX

3. **Documentation**
   - User guide
   - API documentation
   - Tutorial examples

### Phase 3: Expansion

1. **Additional Formal Methods**
2. **Neural Network Integration**
3. **Real-Time Verification Engine**
4. **Community Building**

## Strategic Opportunities

### Unique Value Propositions

1. **Accessibility Leadership**
   - First accessible formal verification tool
   - Could become standard for inclusive math/CS education
   - Opportunity to define best practices

2. **Verified AI**
   - Growing need for trustworthy AI
   - Formal verification of neural networks is hot research area
   - Could enable safety-critical AI applications

3. **Educational Tool**
   - Spatial reasoning may be more intuitive than text
   - Could make formal methods more accessible to beginners
   - Potential for classroom adoption

### Potential Partnerships

## Conclusion

ProveIt is currently a **vision without implementation**, but that vision is **bold and potentially impactful**. The combination of accessibility, formal verification, and spatial reasoning addresses real gaps in existing tools.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Clear articulation of unique approach
2. Early validation with target users (especially blind community)
3. Focused MVP demonstrating core innovation
4. Strong architectural foundation
5. Community engagement

**Next Critical Step:**
Create architectural design document explaining HOW geometric construction enables accessible formal verification. This will guide all subsequent technical decisions.
