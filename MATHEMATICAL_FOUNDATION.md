## Abstract

We present a complete mathematical foundation for ProveIt, a geometric construction environment where spatial reasoning becomes formal verification. Using Smooth Cubical Type Theory (SCTT), we establish a precise correspondence between geometric objects and proof-theoretic structures, enabling real-time verification of constructions while maintaining full accessibility for non-visual interaction.

**Key Innovation**: Geometric constructions are not mere visualizations of proofs—they ARE proofs, with spatial relationships encoding logical dependencies through smooth type-theoretic structure.

## 1. Type-Theoretic Foundation

### 1.1 The ProveIt Universe Hierarchy

We work in a hierarchy of universes with smooth structure:

```
𝒰₀ : 𝒰₁ : 𝒰₂ : ...
```

Each universe 𝒰ᵢ carries:
- **Type structure**: Dependent products, sums, identity types
- **Smooth structure**: C^∞ manifold structure on term spaces
- **Cubical structure**: Interval I and path types

**Definition 1.1** (Smooth Type)
A type `A : 𝒰ᵢ` is *smooth* if it comes equipped with:
1. A smooth manifold structure on its term space `|A|`
2. A smooth composition operation: `comp : ∀ (r s : I) → ...`
3. Coherence conditions ensuring Kan property holds smoothly

### 1.2 Geometric Primitives as Types

**Definition 1.2** (Point Type)
```
Point : 𝒰₀
Point ≜ record
  { coordinates : ℝⁿ
  ; hypothesis : Proposition
  ; witness : Maybe (Term hypothesis)
  ; smooth_str : C^∞(ℝⁿ, |Proposition|)
  }
```

A point represents:
- **Geometrically**: A location in n-dimensional space
- **Logically**: A proposition with optional proof term
- **Smoothly**: A smooth map from coordinates to proposition space

**Definition 1.3** (Line Type)
```
Line : Point → Point → 𝒰₀
Line P Q ≜ record
  { path : I → ℝⁿ
  ; start_at : path 0 ≡ P.coordinates
  ; end_at : path 1 ≡ Q.coordinates
  ; implication : P.hypothesis → Q.hypothesis
  ; proof_transport : (p : Term P.hypothesis) → Term Q.hypothesis
  ; smooth_path : C^∞(I, ℝⁿ)
  }
```

A line represents:
- **Geometrically**: A smooth curve connecting two points
- **Logically**: An implication P → Q
- **Homotopically**: A path in proposition space
- **Proof-theoretically**: Transport of proof terms

**Definition 1.4** (Construction Space)
```
Construction : 𝒰₁
Construction ≜ record
  { points : List Point
  ; lines : List (Σ (P Q : Point), Line P Q)
  ; regions : List (BoundedRegion points lines)
  ; coherence : All_Commute_Diagrams lines
  ; well_founded : No_Circular_Dependencies lines
  }
```

### 1.3 Spatial Relationships as Dependent Types

**Definition 1.5** (Incidence Relation)
```
Incident : Point → Line P Q → Type
Incident R ℓ ≜ Σ (t : I), ℓ.path t ≡ R.coordinates
                × (R.hypothesis follows from {P.hypothesis, Q.hypothesis})
```

**Definition 1.6** (Parallelism)
```
Parallel : Line P₁ Q₁ → Line P₂ Q₂ → Type
Parallel ℓ₁ ℓ₂ ≜
  Σ (f : I → I),
    ( IsSmooth f
    × ∀ t → tangent ℓ₁ t ∼ tangent ℓ₂ (f t)
    × ℓ₁.implication ≡ ℓ₂.implication  -- Same logical content
    )
```

**Definition 1.7** (Perpendicularity)
```
Perpendicular : Line P₁ Q₁ → Line P₂ Q₂ → Type
Perpendicular ℓ₁ ℓ₂ ≜
  Σ (t₁ t₂ : I),
    ( ⟨tangent ℓ₁ t₁, tangent ℓ₂ t₂⟩ ≡ 0
    × ℓ₁.implication ⊥ ℓ₂.implication  -- Logical orthogonality
    )
```

### 1.4 Verification Judgments

**Definition 1.8** (Valid Construction)
```
⊢ C : Construction valid
─────────────────────────
Γ ⊢ C : Construction
Γ ⊢ coherence C : Coherent
Γ ⊢ well_founded C : WellFounded
Γ ⊢ ∀ ℓ ∈ C.lines → ValidImplication ℓ
```

**Definition 1.9** (Proof Extraction)
```
extract : (C : Construction) → ⊢ C valid → Proof (goal C)
extract C validity ≜
  compose_all (map proof_of_line C.lines) (coherence C)
```

## 2. Proof-Geometry Correspondence

### 2.1 The Fundamental Correspondence Principle

**Theorem 2.1** (Curry-Howard-Geometry Correspondence)
There exists a structure-preserving bijection:

```
Φ : GeometricConstructions ≃ FormalProofs
```

Such that:
1. **Points ↔ Propositions**: Each point encodes exactly one proposition
2. **Lines ↔ Implications**: Each line is a constructive proof of implication
3. **Constructions ↔ Proof Trees**: Dependency structure matches exactly
4. **Transformations ↔ Proof Equivalences**: Geometric deformations preserve validity

**Proof Sketch**:
Define Φ recursively:
```
Φ(Point P) = P.hypothesis
Φ(Line P Q) = (Φ P → Φ Q, λ p. transport_along_line p)
Φ(Construction C) = fold_composition (map Φ C.lines)
```

Bijectivity follows from:
- Injectivity: Distinct constructions have distinct proof terms (by coherence)
- Surjectivity: Every proof tree can be laid out geometrically (by well-foundedness)

### 2.2 Extended Correspondences

| Geometric Object | Type Theory | Logic | Category Theory |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| Point | Dependent type | Proposition | Object |
| Line | Dependent function | Implication | Morphism |
| Triangle | Composed functions | Modus ponens | Composition |
| Circle | Recursive type | Induction | Initial algebra |
| Parallel lines | Equal types | Equivalence | Isomorphism |
| Intersection | Product type | Conjunction | Product object |
| Union | Sum type | Disjunction | Coproduct |
| Region | Subtype | Restricted proposition | Subobject |
| Angle | Proof complexity | Derivation length | Arrow count |
| Distance | Type distance | Logical distance | Hom-set size |

### 2.3 Higher-Dimensional Constructions

**Definition 2.2** (Surface Type)
```
Surface : (P Q R : Point) → Line P Q → Line Q R → Line R P → 𝒰₀
Surface P Q R ℓ₁ ℓ₂ ℓ₃ ≜
  record
  { filling : I² → ℝⁿ
  ; boundary₀ : ∀ t → filling (t, 0) ≡ ℓ₁.path t
  ; boundary₁ : ∀ t → filling (t, 1) ≡ ℓ₃.path (1-t)
  ; boundary_left : ∀ t → filling (0, t) ≡ P.coordinates
  ; boundary_right : ∀ t → filling (1, t) ≡ ℓ₂.path t
  ; composition_proof : (ℓ₁.impl ∘ ℓ₂.impl ∘ ℓ₃.impl) ≡ id
  }
```

A surface encodes:
- **Geometrically**: A 2-dimensional region bounded by lines
- **Logically**: A proof that composed implications form an identity
- **Homotopically**: A 2-path showing equivalence of proof paths

**Definition 2.3** (Volume Type)
```
Volume : BoundedBy (surfaces : List Surface) → 𝒰₀
Volume bounded_by ≜
  record
  { interior : I³ → ℝⁿ
  ; boundary_match : ∀ s ∈ surfaces → s embeds_in boundary interior
  ; higher_coherence : All commutative diagrams hold
  ; proof_normalization : Canonical form of composed proof
  }
```

### 2.4 Construction Algebra

**Definition 2.4** (Construction Composition)
```
_⊕_ : Construction → Construction → Construction
C₁ ⊕ C₂ ≜
  { points = C₁.points ∪ C₂.points
  ; lines = C₁.lines ∪ C₂.lines ∪ connecting_lines
  ; coherence = composed_coherence C₁.coherence C₂.coherence
  }
  where
    connecting_lines = infer_new_implications C₁ C₂
```

**Theorem 2.2** (Associativity of Construction)
```
(C₁ ⊕ C₂) ⊕ C₃ ≡ C₁ ⊕ (C₂ ⊕ C₃)
```

**Proof**: By smoothness of composition operations and coherence preservation.

---

## 3. Categorical Structure

### 3.1 The Category ProveIt

**Definition 3.1** (ProveIt Category)
```
ProveIt : Category
ProveIt ≜
  { Obj = Point
  ; Hom P Q = Line P Q
  ; id P = SelfImplication P
  ; _∘_ = LineComposition
  ; left_id = refl
  ; right_id = refl
  ; assoc = surface_coherence
  }
```

**Theorem 3.1** (ProveIt is Smooth)
The category ProveIt has smooth composition: the composition operation
```
_∘_ : Hom Q R × Hom P Q → Hom P R
```
is a smooth map between manifolds.

**Proof**: By Definition 1.3, each Line has smooth_path : C^∞(I, ℝⁿ). Composition is defined by:
```
(ℓ₂ ∘ ℓ₁).path t = if t ≤ 0.5
                    then ℓ₁.path (2t)
                    else ℓ₂.path (2t - 1)
```
This is smooth by the gluing lemma for smooth functions, using the fact that paths agree at endpoints.

### 3.2 Functors and Natural Transformations

**Definition 3.2** (Proof Extraction Functor)
```
Extract : ProveIt → Type_Theory
Extract P = P.hypothesis
Extract (Line P Q) = P.hypothesis → Q.hypothesis
Extract_fmap (ℓ : Line P Q) = ℓ.proof_transport
```

**Theorem 3.2** (Extract is Faithful)
If `ℓ₁ ≠ ℓ₂ : Line P Q`, then `Extract ℓ₁ ≠ Extract ℓ₂`.

**Definition 3.3** (Spatial Layout Functor)
```
Layout : Type_Theory → ProveIt
Layout A = Point with hypothesis = A
Layout (f : A → B) = Line (Layout A) (Layout B)
```

**Theorem 3.3** (Adjunction)
```
Extract ⊣ Layout
```

**Proof**: The unit and counit are:
```
η : Id → Layout ∘ Extract
η_P : P → Layout (Extract P)
η_P = identity_at_coordinates

ε : Extract ∘ Layout → Id
ε_A : Extract (Layout A) → A
ε_A = projection_to_hypothesis
```

Triangle identities follow from coherence conditions.

### 3.4 Monoidal Structure

**Definition 3.4** (Tensor Product of Constructions)
```
_⊗_ : Construction → Construction → Construction
C₁ ⊗ C₂ ≜
  { points = { (P₁, P₂) | P₁ ∈ C₁.points, P₂ ∈ C₂.points }
  ; lines = { (ℓ₁, ℓ₂) | ℓ₁ ∈ C₁.lines, ℓ₂ ∈ C₂.lines }
  ; coherence = product_coherence
  }
```

**Theorem 3.4** (Symmetric Monoidal Category)
(ProveIt, ⊗, Unit_Construction, α, λ, ρ, σ) forms a symmetric monoidal category.

### 3.5 Diagram Commutativity

**Definition 3.5** (Commutative Square)
```
CommutativeSquare : (P Q R S : Point)
                  → Line P Q → Line Q S → Line P R → Line R S
                  → Type
CommutativeSquare P Q R S f g h k ≜
  Σ (homotopy : I² → ℝⁿ),
    ( boundary_conditions homotopy
    × g.impl ∘ f.impl ≡ k.impl ∘ h.impl
    × smooth_homotopy homotopy
    )
```

**Verification Algorithm** (Diagram Commutativity):
```
check_commutative : CommutativeSquare → Bool
check_commutative square =
  let path1 = compose square.g square.f
      path2 = compose square.k square.h
  in definitionally_equal path1.impl path2.impl
     ∧ smooth_homotopic path1.path path2.path
```

## 4. Homotopy-Theoretic Interpretation

### 4.1 Paths as Proof Equivalences

**Definition 4.1** (Proof Path Type)
```
ProofPath : {A B : Type} → (f g : A → B) → Type
ProofPath {A} {B} f g ≜
  Σ (p : I → (A → B)),
    ( p 0 ≡ f
    × p 1 ≡ g
    × ∀ t → smooth (p t)
    × ∀ (a : A) → Path B (f a) (g a)
    )
```

**Theorem 4.1** (Proof Equivalence)
If `ProofPath f g`, then f and g are interchangeable in all contexts.

**Proof**: By path induction and function extensionality, transported through smooth structure.

### 4.2 Higher Inductive Types for Geometric Axioms

**Definition 4.2** (Euclidean Plane as HIT)
```
data EuclideanPlane : Type where
  origin : EuclideanPlane
  extend : (p : EuclideanPlane) → (v : ℝ²) → EuclideanPlane

  -- Axioms as path constructors
  parallel_postulate :
    ∀ (ℓ : Line) (P : Point) → ¬(Incident P ℓ)
    → ∃! (ℓ' : Line) → Incident P ℓ' × Parallel ℓ ℓ'

  smooth_axiom :
    ∀ (p q : EuclideanPlane) → C^∞ (λ t → interpolate p q t)
```

**Definition 4.3** (Circle as HIT)
```
data Circle : Type where
  base : Circle
  loop : base ≡ base

  -- Smooth structure
  smooth_loop : C^∞(I, Circle) where smooth_loop 0 ≡ smooth_loop 1
```

Interpretation: A circle in ProveIt represents:
- **Geometrically**: The traditional circle shape
- **Logically**: A recursive proof structure (base case + inductive step)
- **Homotopically**: The fundamental 1-sphere S¹
- **Type-theoretically**: ℤ as π₁(S¹)

### 4.3 Univalence for Proof Transformation

**Axiom 4.1** (Univalence for Constructions)
```
univalence : (C₁ C₂ : Construction)
           → (C₁ ≃ C₂) ≃ (C₁ ≡ C₂)
```

**Interpretation**: Equivalent constructions (same proof content) are indistinguishable.

**Corollary 4.2** (Proof Refactoring Principle)
Any geometric transformation that preserves equivalence preserves correctness:
```
refactor : (C : Construction) → (f : C ≃ C') → ⊢ C valid → ⊢ C' valid
refactor C f validity = transport (⊢_valid) (ua f) validity
```

### 4.4 Kan Operations for Partial Constructions

**Definition 4.4** (Partial Construction)
```
PartialConstruction : Type
PartialConstruction ≜
  record
  { complete_parts : Construction
  ; missing_region : I^n → Maybe Point
  ; boundary : ∂(missing_region) ⊆ complete_parts
  }
```

**Definition 4.5** (Kan Filling for Constructions)
```
fill : (partial : PartialConstruction)
     → (consistent : boundary_conditions partial)
     → Construction
fill partial consistent ≜
  comp (λ i → Construction)
       partial.complete_parts
       (λ { i=0 → partial.complete_parts
          ; i=1 → inferred_completion
          })
       consistent
```

**Theorem 4.3** (Kan Property)
Every partial construction with consistent boundaries can be filled uniquely (up to homotopy).

**Proof**: By smooth Kan property of SCTT and well-foundedness of dependency graph.

## 5. Non-Visual Representation Theory

### 5.1 Algebraic Serialization

**Definition 5.1** (Construction Language)
```
data ConstructionExpr : Type where
  point : Name → Proposition → ConstructionExpr
  line : Name → Name → (Prop → Prop) → ConstructionExpr
  compose : ConstructionExpr → ConstructionExpr → ConstructionExpr
  parallel : Name → Name → ConstructionExpr
  perpendicular : Name → Name → ConstructionExpr
  construct : (recipe : ConstructionExpr) → Construction
```

**Example**:
```
-- Visual: Triangle with altitude
-- Non-visual:
construction "triangle_altitude" $
  point "A" (hypothesis_a)
  >> point "B" (hypothesis_b)
  >> point "C" (hypothesis_c)
  >> line "AB" "A" "B" (impl_a_b)
  >> line "BC" "B" "C" (impl_b_c)
  >> line "CA" "C" "A" (impl_c_a)
  >> point "H" (derived_h)
  >> line "AH" "A" "H" (altitude_impl)
  >> perpendicular "AH" "BC"
  >> verify_construction
```

### 5.2 Textual Proof Navigation

**Definition 5.2** (Construction Tree)
```
data CTree : Type where
  leaf : Point → CTree
  branch : Line → CTree → CTree → CTree
  forest : List CTree → CTree
```

**Navigation Commands**:
```
enter : CTree → Focus CTree       -- Descend into subconstruction
exit : Focus CTree → CTree        -- Return to parent
sibling : Focus CTree → Focus CTree   -- Move to adjacent proof
summary : Focus CTree → String    -- Describe current position
dependencies : Focus CTree → List Point  -- What this depends on
```

**Example Navigation Session**:
```
> load "pythagoras_proof"
Construction loaded: 15 points, 23 lines, 3 regions

> summary
"Main proof: Right triangle ABC with squares on each side"

> enter
Focus: Square on hypotenuse
Dependencies: Points A, B, line AB, right_angle_at_C

> list_siblings
- Square on leg AC
- Square on leg BC
- Altitude from C to AB

> goto "altitude"
Focus: Altitude construction
Type: Line C H perpendicular AB

> verify
✓ Perpendicularity holds
✓ H lies on AB
✓ Implies area relationship

> proof_path
A → C → right_angle → altitude → similarity → area_ratio → pythagorean_theorem
```

### 5.3 Auditory Representation

**Definition 5.3** (Sonic Construction Encoding)
```
sonify : Construction → AudioStream
sonify C ≜
  { pitch_of point P = frequency_of (complexity P.hypothesis)
  ; rhythm_of line L = duration_of (proof_length L.implication)
  ; timbre_of region R = harmonic_series (coherence_degree R)
  ; spatial_of point P = stereo_position P.coordinates
  }
```

**Mapping Rules**:
- **Points**: Distinct pitches (higher = more complex hypothesis)
- **Lines**: Glissando from source point pitch to target point pitch
- **Parallel lines**: Harmonically related (perfect fifth)
- **Perpendicular lines**: Dissonant interval (tritone)
- **Valid construction**: Consonant resolution
- **Invalid construction**: Dissonant/unresolved

### 5.4 Haptic Feedback for Tactile Exploration

**Definition 5.4** (Haptic Construction Model)
```
tactile_map : Construction → HapticDevice → FeedbackStream
tactile_map C device ≜
  { vibration_intensity = λ p → gradient_magnitude_at p
  ; texture_roughness = λ p → logical_complexity_at p
  ; resistance_force = λ p → dependency_depth_at p
  ; temperature = λ p → proof_confidence_at p
  }
```

**Interaction Modes**:
1. **Surface exploration**: Move stylus over virtual construction plane
2. **Edge following**: Stylus "snaps" to lines, vibrates at intersections
3. **Depth sensing**: Pressure indicates proof depth/complexity
4. **Angle detection**: Rotation resistance indicates angular relationships

### 5.5 Accessibility-First Type Theory

**Principle 5.1** (Representation Independence)
All type-theoretic operations must be expressible without reference to spatial coordinates:
```
∀ (op : Construction → Construction),
  ∃ (op_algebraic : ConstructionExpr → ConstructionExpr),
    ∀ C, construct (op_algebraic (serialize C)) ≡ op C
```

**Theorem 5.1** (Completeness of Non-Visual Representation)
Every geometric construction has a canonical non-visual representation that preserves all proof-theoretic content.

**Proof**: By construction of serialization functor and adjunction with visualization functor.

## 6. Real-Time Verification Algorithms

### 6.1 Incremental Type Checking

**Algorithm 6.1** (Incremental Construction Verification)
```
incremental_verify : (C : Construction)
                   → (addition : ConstructionElement)
                   → (prev_valid : ⊢ C valid)
                   → Result (⊢ (C ⊕ addition) valid)

incremental_verify C addition prev_valid =
  match addition with
  | Add_Point P →
      if well_typed P.hypothesis
        then success (extend_proof prev_valid P)
        else error (InvalidHypothesis P)

  | Add_Line L@(Line P Q) →
      if P ∈ C.points ∧ Q ∈ C.points
        then if check_implication P.hypothesis Q.hypothesis L.impl
          then if smooth L.path
            then check_coherence (C.lines ∪ {L}) >>= λ coh →
                 success (extend_with_line prev_valid L coh)
            else error (NonSmoothPath L)
          else error (InvalidImplication L)
        else error (DanglingEndpoints L)

  | Add_Region R →
      if boundary R ⊆ C.lines
        then check_filling R >>= λ fill →
             success (extend_with_region prev_valid R fill)
        else error (IncompleteBoundary R)
```

**Complexity**: O(log n) for point addition, O(n) for line addition (checking coherence with existing lines), where n is construction size.

### 6.2 Kan Completion for Partial Proofs

**Algorithm 6.2** (Automatic Proof Completion)
```
auto_complete : PartialConstruction → Maybe Construction
auto_complete partial =
  match analyze_gap partial with
  | Fillable_By_Kan →
      -- Use smooth Kan filling
      let faces = boundary_faces partial
          tube = hcom_construction faces
      in Just (fill_kan partial tube)

  | Needs_Lemma lemma_type →
      -- Search lemma database
      search_database lemma_type >>= λ lemma →
      Just (instantiate_lemma lemma partial)

  | Underdetermined →
      -- Multiple valid completions, ask user
      Nothing

  | Inconsistent →
      -- No valid completion exists
      Nothing
```

**Heuristics**:
1. **Local coherence**: Check if nearby faces are consistent
2. **Type inference**: Deduce types of missing elements from context
3. **Proof search**: Use automated theorem proving for small gaps
4. **Symmetry exploitation**: Use geometric symmetries to propagate solutions

### 6.3 Error Localization

**Algorithm 6.3** (Inconsistency Diagnosis)
```
diagnose : Construction → ¬(⊢ Construction valid) → ErrorReport
diagnose C invalidity =
  let conflict_set = minimal_conflicting_subset C
      root_cause = analyze_dependencies conflict_set
  in { location = spatial_center conflict_set
     ; description = explain_conflict root_cause
     ; suggestions = propose_fixes conflict_set
     ; highlight = conflict_set
     }

minimal_conflicting_subset : Construction → Set ConstructionElement
minimal_conflicting_subset C =
  -- Use binary search on dependency graph
  fix (λ recurse subset →
    if ⊢ subset valid
      then subset ∪ {next_element}
      else if |subset| = 1
        then subset
        else let (left, right) = bisect subset
             in if ¬(⊢ left valid)
                  then recurse left
                  else recurse right
  ) C.elements
```

**Theorem 6.1** (Soundness of Error Localization)
If `diagnose C invalidity = report`, then `report.location` contains at least one invalid element.

**Theorem 6.2** (Minimality)
The reported conflict set is minimal: removing any element makes it valid.

### 6.4 Real-Time Smoothness Checking

**Algorithm 6.4** (Smooth Path Verification)
```
check_smooth : (path : I → ℝⁿ) → (order : ℕ) → Bool
check_smooth path order =
  let samples = sample_points path 1000
      derivatives = compute_derivatives path order samples
  in all (λ d → is_continuous d ∧ is_bounded d) derivatives

sample_points : (I → ℝⁿ) → ℕ → List (I × ℝⁿ)
sample_points f n = map (λ i → (i/n, f(i/n))) [0..n]

compute_derivatives : (I → ℝⁿ) → ℕ → List (I × ℝⁿ) → List (I → ℝⁿ)
compute_derivatives f 0 _ = [f]
compute_derivatives f (k+1) samples =
  let d_f = numerical_derivative f samples
  in f :: compute_derivatives d_f k (sample_points d_f 1000)
```

**Optimization**: Cache derivatives computed during construction for reuse in verification.

### 6.5 Parallel Verification Architecture

**Algorithm 6.5** (Distributed Verification)
```
parallel_verify : Construction → Cluster → Result Valid
parallel_verify C cluster =
  let components = strongly_connected_components (dependency_graph C)
      tasks = map (λ comp → async (verify_component comp)) components
  in await_all tasks >>= combine_results
```

**Distribution Strategy**:
- **Independent subproofs**: Verify in parallel
- **Dependent subproofs**: Pipeline with streaming results
- **Shared lemmas**: Cache and broadcast across workers

**Theorem 7.1** (Zero-Knowledge Verifiability)
A node can verify that a construction is valid without learning the construction details.

**Protocol 7.2** (ZK Proof Verification)
```
verify_zkp : ProofCertificate → Bool
verify_zkp cert =
  let public_input = (cert.merkle_root, cert.construction.goal)
      zk_valid = zkp_verify cert.zkp_proof public_input
      sig_valid = verify_signature cert.signature
  in zk_valid ∧ sig_valid
```

### 7.4 Incentive-Compatible Proof Markets

**Definition 7.4** (Proof Bounty)
```
ProofBounty : Type
ProofBounty ≜
  record
  { goal : Proposition
  ; reward : ℝ≥0
  ; deadline : Timestamp
  ; verification_committee : Set ButterflyNode
  ; escrow : CryptographicCommitment
  }
```

**Mechanism Design**:
1. **Reward function**: Higher rewards for harder proofs, earlier completions
2. **Verification incentives**: Validators rewarded for catching invalid proofs
3. **Reputation system**: Trust scores increase with valid contributions
4. **Slashing conditions**: Penalties for submitting invalid proofs

### 7.5 Fault-Tolerant Consensus

**Algorithm 7.1** (Byzantine-Resistant Proof Validation)
```
byzantine_consensus : List ButterflyNode
                    → Construction
                    → Maybe (⊢ Construction valid)
byzantine_consensus nodes C =
  let validations = map (λ n → n.verify C) nodes
      votes = count_votes validations
  in if votes.valid ≥ (2 * votes.invalid + 1)
       then Just (aggregate_witnesses validations)
       else Nothing
```

**Theorem 7.2** (Safety Under Byzantine Faults)
If at most f nodes are Byzantine and we have 3f+1 total nodes, then:
1. Valid constructions are never rejected
2. Invalid constructions are never accepted
3. Agreement is reached in O(log n) rounds

## 8. Worked Examples

### 8.1 Example: Modus Ponens as Geometric Construction

**Goal**: Prove Q from premises P and P→Q.

**Geometric Construction**:
```
construction "modus_ponens" =
  -- Premises as points
  point "P" (premise_p : P)
  >> point "P_implies_Q" (premise_impl : P → Q)

  -- Derive intermediate point
  >> point "Q_derived" (goal_q : Q)

  -- Implication as line
  >> line "apply_impl" "P" "Q_derived"
       (λ p → premise_impl p)

  -- Mark that P_implies_Q witnesses the line
  >> incident "P_implies_Q" "apply_impl"

  -- Verification
  >> verify_construction
```

**Type-Theoretic Translation**:
```
extract "modus_ponens" =
  λ (premise_p : P) (premise_impl : P → Q) →
    premise_impl premise_p : Q
```

**Non-Visual Representation**:
```
> describe "modus_ponens"
Construction: Modus Ponens
Structure: Triangle with 3 points
- Point 0 "P": Premise of type P
- Point 1 "P_implies_Q": Implication premise
- Point 2 "Q_derived": Conclusion of type Q
Connections:
- Line from P to Q_derived (direct implication)
- P_implies_Q lies on this line (witnesses the implication)
Proof trace: P → apply_impl → Q
```

### 8.2 Example: Pythagorean Theorem

**Goal**: Prove a² + b² = c² for right triangle with legs a, b and hypotenuse c.

**Geometric Construction**:
```
construction "pythagorean" =
  -- Right triangle
  point "A" (right_triangle_vertex : RightTriangle)
  >> point "B" (vertex_b : Point)
  >> point "C" (vertex_c : Point)
  >> line "AB" "A" "B" (leg_a : Length)
  >> line "BC" "B" "C" (leg_b : Length)
  >> line "CA" "C" "A" (hypotenuse_c : Length)
  >> perpendicular "AB" "BC"

  -- Squares on each side (represented as regions)
  >> region "square_a" (boundary = 4 copies of "AB")
           (area_a = a²)
  >> region "square_b" (boundary = 4 copies of "BC")
           (area_b = b²)
  >> region "square_c" (boundary = 4 copies of "CA")
           (area_c = c²)

  -- Altitude from C to AB
  >> point "H" (foot_of_altitude : Point)
  >> line "CH" "C" "H" (altitude : Line)
  >> perpendicular "CH" "AB"
  >> incident "H" "AB"

  -- Similarity proofs (encoded as parallel lines)
  >> line "similarity_1" "triangle_ACH" "triangle_ABC"
           (similar_by_aa : Similarity)
  >> line "similarity_2" "triangle_BCH" "triangle_ABC"
           (similar_by_aa : Similarity)

  -- Area composition (encoded as surface)
  >> surface "area_proof"
       (area_c ≡ area_a + area_b)
       (by_decomposition : Proof)

  >> verify_construction
```

**Verification Steps**:
1. Check right angle at B: ✓
2. Check perpendicularity of altitude: ✓
3. Verify similarity ratios: ✓
4. Verify area relationships via surface coherence: ✓
5. Extract proof term: ✓

**Non-Visual Navigation**:
```
> load "pythagorean"
> summary
"Right triangle with squares on sides, proved via similarity"

> list_components
- Core triangle: 3 points, 3 lines
- Squares: 3 regions, 12 additional lines
- Altitude construction: 1 point, 1 line
- Similarity proofs: 2 lines (abstract)
- Area equality: 1 surface

> verify_step "similarity_1"
Checking: Triangle ACH ~ Triangle ABC
Method: Angle-Angle similarity
- Angle at A is shared ✓
- Angle AHC = 90° (altitude) ✓
- Angle ABC = 90° (given) ✓
Conclusion: Triangles are similar ✓

> extract_proof
Proof term (simplified):
λ (triangle : RightTriangle a b c) →
  let altitude = construct_altitude triangle
      sim1 = similarity_by_aa triangle.ACH triangle.ABC
      sim2 = similarity_by_aa triangle.BCH triangle.ABC
      ratio1 = extract_ratio sim1  -- a/c = c/hyp_projection
      ratio2 = extract_ratio sim2  -- b/c = c/hyp_projection
  in area_algebra ratio1 ratio2 : a² + b² ≡ c²
```

### 8.3 Example: Curry's Paradox (Invalid Construction)

**Attempted Goal**: Prove ⊥ (false) from no premises.

**Invalid Construction Attempt**:
```
construction "curry_paradox" =
  point "P" (P_def : P ↔ (P → ⊥))
  >> line "forward" "P" "P_implies_false"
       (λ p → (fst P_def) p p : ⊥)
  >> line "backward" "P_implies_false" "P"
       (λ impl → (snd P_def) impl)
  >> compose "forward" "backward"  -- Creates cycle!
  >> point "False" (derived_false : ⊥)
```

**Verification Output**:
```
ERROR: Circular dependency detected
Location: Lines "forward" and "backward"
Conflict:
  - "forward" requires P to derive ⊥
  - "backward" requires (P → ⊥) to derive P
  - Composition creates dependency cycle: P → ⊥ → P

Diagnosis: This construction violates well-foundedness
Suggestion: The definition of P is impredicative and rejected in type theory
```

**Non-Visual Error Report**:
```
> verify "curry_paradox"
✗ Verification failed

> diagnose
Error type: Circular dependency
Minimal conflict set:
  - Point "P" (definition uses P in its own type)
  - Line "forward" (depends on P)
  - Line "backward" (produces P)

Root cause: Impredicative type definition
P : Type
P ↔ (P → ⊥)  -- P appears on both sides

This violates the positivity requirement of inductive types.

Suggestion: Remove impredicative definition or mark as axiom (non-computational)
```

## Conclusion

ProveIt represents a paradigm shift in formal verification: geometric intuition becomes rigorous proof, spatial reasoning becomes type checking, and accessibility is not an afterthought but the foundation.

By grounding everything in Smooth Cubical Type Theory, we achieve:
1. **Rigorous foundations**: Every construction is a proof term
2. **Computational efficiency**: NbE and incremental checking scale to large proofs
3. **Accessibility**: Algebraic representations are primary, not derived
4. **Distributability**: Proofs decompose naturally for parallel verification
5. **Expressiveness**: Full power of dependent types and homotopy theory

This is formal methods for everyone—blind mathematicians, visual thinkers, and AI agents working together in a shared mathematical space where the only thing that matters is correctness.

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement core type engine (see Phase 1)
2. Design concrete syntax for construction language
3. Build non-visual REPL interface
4. Develop test suite of classical geometric proofs
5. Integrate with Butterfly infrastructure

The future of verification is geometric, smooth, and accessible. Let's build it.
