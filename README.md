# ProveIt
Geometric construction environment for accessible formal verification. Build proofs, verify systems, and compose neural networks through spatial reasoning. Supports multiple formal methods (type theory, category theory, homotopy) with real-time verification. Designed accessibility-first for blind, neurodivergent, and post-injury users.
