# Butterfly: Executive Summary

## Vision Statement

**Butterfly is a revolutionary distributed LLM inference system that achieves true parallel inference through functional decomposition, intelligent combination, and Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, while maintaining accessibility-first design principles.**

## The Core Innovation

Traditional distributed inference splits models sequentially (layer-by-layer), creating bottlenecks. Butterfly splits models **functionally** (by reasoning capability), enabling parallel execution and emergent intelligence through ensemble effects.

```
Traditional Layer Parallelism:
  Input → [Layers 1-8] → [Layers 9-16] → [Layers 17-24] → Output
           Worker A        Worker B         Worker C
           Sequential, 3x latency

Butterfly Functional Decomposition:
  Input → ┬→ [Logic Specialist] ────→ ┐
          ├→ [Pattern Specialist] ──→ ├→ [Smooth Fusion] → Output
          └→ [Formal Specialist] ───→ ┘
          Parallel, emergent intelligence
```

**Result:** 3-6x speedup + improved accuracy through specialization and ensemble effects.

## Key Deliverables

  ||M(x) - F(W₁(x),...,W_k(x))|| < ε
```
Proven via spectral decomposition and smooth approximation theory.

```
where W_C is the specialist for C. Proven via fusion monotonicity.

```
Graceful degradation guaranteed by smooth Lipschitz-continuous fusion.

### 4. Byzantine Consensus ([CONSENSUS.md](./CONSENSUS.md))

**Wingbeat Protocol**
Novel BFT protocol optimized for LLM inference:

**Phases:**
1. **Pre-Prepare**: Head node broadcasts query
2. **Prepare**: Workers compute outputs with proofs
3. **Commit**: Workers verify each other's outputs
4. **Finalize**: Head node selects consensus value

**Key Features:**
- Semantic consensus (semantically similar, not byte-identical)
- Parallel verification (workers verify simultaneously)
- Smooth interpolation for conflict resolution
- Proof-carrying responses (verifiable reasoning traces)

**Guarantees:**
- **Safety**: All honest workers agree (if f < n/3 Byzantine)
- **Liveness**: System terminates within bounded time
- **Complexity**: O(n²) messages, O(Δ) latency per round

**Optimizations:**
- Fast path: Skip verification if high agreement (>95% similarity)
- Incremental consensus: Agree on tokens as they're generated
- Parallel verification: Verify proofs concurrently
- Optimistic execution: Return early high-confidence results

**Security:**
- Tolerates f < n/3 Byzantine workers
- Cryptographic signatures prevent forgery
- Reputation system tracks worker reliability
- View change protocol handles leader failures

  ↓ (decode)
ProofTerm ∈ SCTT (formal verification)
```
