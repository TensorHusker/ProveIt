# ProveIt Architectural Alternatives

**Comparing Foundational Approaches**

---

## Overview

ProveIt can be built with three fundamentally different architectures. This document compares them to inform the architectural decision.

---

## Path A: TTT as Minimal Core

### Architecture

```
ProveIt (Visual Layer)
    ↓
TTT (Tiny Type Theory - Minimal Core)
    ↑
Compilers from:
    - SCTT (smooth mathematics)
    - CIC/Lean (classical mathematics)
    - HoTT (homotopy theory)
    - MLTT (constructive)
    - ZFC (set theory)
```

### Key Characteristics

**Single Foundation**: Everything ultimately compiles to TTT
**Thermodynamic**: Minimal operations → minimal energy
**Hardware Target**: Neural accelerators (M5, RTX Tensor Cores)
**Verification**: Prove TTT correct, inherit correctness via compilation

### Advantages

#### 1. **Thermodynamic Optimality**
- Minimal operations = minimal energy consumption
- Physics favors minimal computation over time
- Competitive advantage through efficiency

#### 2. **Hardware Co-Evolution**
- Neural accelerators optimize FOR TTT
- TTT becomes "assembly language" of neural hardware
- Market pressure creates lock-in effect

#### 3. **Verification Bedrock**
- One core to verify (not N backends)
- Proved correct once, trusted everywhere
- Smallest attack surface

#### 4. **Economic Clarity**
- Common substrate for pricing proofs (Libertalia)
- Computational cost measurable in TTT operations
- Market can compare proof costs across theories

#### 5. **Catastrophic Failure Prevention**
- Minimal code = fewer bugs
- Bugs confined to translation layers
- Core is provably correct

### Disadvantages

#### 1. **Translation Overhead**
- Every proof pays compilation cost: Theory → TTT
- Smooth math discretized, possibly inefficient
- Classical logic compiled to constructive, proof size blowup
- Overhead might negate thermodynamic advantage

#### 2. **Unnatural Encodings**
- Some mathematics doesn't fit naturally into TTT
- Forcing square pegs into round holes
- May lose elegant structure in translation

#### 3. **Upfront Investment**
- Must design TTT specification
- Must build verified compilers for each theory
- Must prove TTT metatheory correct
- 1-2 years before value realization

#### 4. **Rigidity**
- Committed to one foundation
- Hard to pivot if TTT proves inadequate
- May alienate existing mathematical communities

#### 5. **Unproven Assumptions**
- Thermodynamic advantage not yet validated
- Hardware co-evolution not guaranteed
- Market demand for verified neural compute unknown

### Implementation Complexity

**Core Development**:
- TTT specification: 3-6 months
- TTT metatheory proof: 6-12 months
- Verified compilers: 3-6 months each

**Total**: 18-24 months minimum

**Critical Path**:
- TTT spec must be complete before compilers
- Compilers must be correct before trust
- Long time before user-facing value

### Best For

- **Long-term vision**: Thermodynamically optimal verified computation
- **Hardware co-evolution**: Influencing neural accelerator design
- **Maximum verification**: Provably correct bedrock
- **Economic efficiency**: Accurate proof pricing

## Path B: Theory-Agnostic Meta-Framework

### Architecture

```
ProveIt (Visual Manipulation Layer)
    ↓
Backend Interface (Pluggable)
    ↓
Multiple Independent Theories:
    - SCTT (smooth cubical type theory)
    - CIC (Lean/Coq - classical)
    - HoTT (homotopy type theory)
    - MLTT (constructive)
    - ZFC (set theory)
    - Custom theories as needed
```

### Key Characteristics

**Multiple Foundations**: Theories are peers, not hierarchy
**Pragmatic**: Work with existing ecosystems
**Flexible**: Right tool for each problem
**Evolutionary**: Add new theories as they emerge

### Advantages

#### 1. **Maximum Flexibility**
- Smooth math stays smooth (SCTT)
- Discrete math stays discrete (combinatorial theories)
- Classical math uses classical logic (CIC)
- No forced encodings or translations

#### 2. **Pragmatic Adoption**
- Work directly with Lean's mathlib4 (1M+ lines)
- Import from Coq, Agda, Isabelle
- ProveIt becomes universal frontend
- Doesn't compete with existing foundations

#### 3. **Fast Time to Value**
- Build on existing SCTT implementation
- Add backends incrementally
- Ship to users immediately
- Value realization in 3-6 months

#### 4. **Universal Translator**
- Bridge between mathematical communities
- SCTT proof → export to Lean
- Lean proof → import to ProveIt
- Cross-pollination of ideas

#### 5. **Evolutionary**
- New theories emerge, add them as backends
- Let best theories win for their domains
- Not locked into yesterday's foundation

### Disadvantages

#### 1. **No Common Substrate**
- Can't optimize hardware for one target
- Each theory requires separate optimization
- Hardware stays general-purpose

#### 2. **Verification Distributed**
- Must trust N backends, not one core
- Each backend has its own verification burden
- No single bedrock to prove correct

#### 3. **Economic Complexity**
- How do you price proofs across theories?
- Computational costs not directly comparable
- Market inefficiency from lack of common measure

#### 4. **Composition Challenges**
- How do you compose proofs from different theories?
- Translation layers needed between backends
- Some translations may be lossy or inefficient

#### 5. **Thermodynamic Disadvantage?**
- If TTT truly is optimal, this architecture misses it
- Competitors with minimal core could be more efficient
- Risk of being outcompeted on energy consumption

### Implementation Complexity

**Core Development**:
- Backend interface: 1-2 months
- SCTT backend (existing): 0 months
- CIC/Lean backend: 2-3 months
- Additional backends: 2-3 months each

**Total**: 3-6 months for MVP with 2 backends

**Critical Path**:
- Interface design
- One additional backend (Lean/CIC)
- User testing

### Best For

- **Near-term value**: Ship to users quickly
- **Ecosystem integration**: Work with existing tools
- **Flexibility**: Different problems, different tools
- **Market validation**: Let users guide development

## Path C: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

### Architecture

```
Phase 1 (0-6 months): Theory-Agnostic
ProveIt (Visual Layer)
    ↓
Backend Interface
    ↓
    - SCTT (current)
    - CIC/Lean (add)

Phase 2 (6-12 months): Add TTT Research
Continue Phase 1 + Research TTT in parallel

Phase 3 (12+ months): Integration (if validated)
ProveIt (Visual Layer)
    ↓
Backend Interface
    ↓
    - SCTT
    - CIC/Lean
    - TTT (new)
    - Others

Where TTT can also be compilation target:
    SCTT → TTT
    CIC → TTT
```

### Key Characteristics

**Staged**: Don't block on TTT decision
**Evidence-Based**: Validate before committing
**Flexible**: TTT is option, not requirement
**Pragmatic**: Near-term value + long-term vision

### Advantages

#### 1. **No Sunk Cost**
- Build theory-agnostic first (fast value)
- Research TTT in parallel (don't block)
- If TTT fails, no wasted effort
- If TTT succeeds, add it as backend

#### 2. **Market Validation**
- Ship to users immediately
- Gather real usage data
- Discover actual pain points
- Let demand guide TTT investment

#### 3. **Risk Mitigation**
- Don't assume thermodynamic advantage
- Validate assumptions with experiments
- Make decisions based on evidence
- Maintain optionality throughout

#### 4. **Best of Both**
- Near-term: Flexibility and ecosystem integration
- Long-term: Thermodynamic optimality (if validated)
- Not forced to choose prematurely

#### 5. **Evolutionary**
- If TTT proves valuable, it naturally grows
- If not, focus on optimizing existing backends
- Let physics/markets decide, not dogma

### Disadvantages

#### 1. **Complexity**
- Maintain multiple backends
- TTT adds complexity if adopted
- More code to maintain long-term

#### 2. **Delayed Optimization**
- Hardware co-evolution window might close
- Later TTT adoption less impactful
- First-mover advantage lost

#### 3. **Architectural Refactoring**
- May need to refactor if TTT added later
- Backend interface must support both models
- Some redundancy in development

### Implementation Path

**Phase 1 (0-6 months): Theory-Agnostic ProveIt**
- Keep current SCTT implementation
- Add backend interface layer
- Implement Lean/CIC backend
- Ship to users
- **Deliverable**: Working ProveIt with 2 backends

**Phase 2 (0-6 months, parallel): TTT Research**
- Design TTT specification
- Test discrete encodings in SCTT
- Prototype SCTT → TTT compiler
- Benchmark neural accelerator integration
- Market research
- **Deliverable**: Go/No-Go decision on TTT

**Phase 3 (6-12 months): Integration or Optimization**

*If TTT validated:*
- Add TTT as backend to ProveIt
- Build verified compilers: SCTT → TTT, CIC → TTT
- Target Metal/CUDA for neural hardware
- Maintain theory-agnostic architecture (TTT is option)

*If TTT not validated:*
- Optimize existing backends (SCTT, CIC)
- Add more backends (HoTT, MLTT)
- Focus on translation layers between theories
- Explore direct neural hardware targeting from SCTT

### Best For

- **Pragmatic teams**: Want value now, vision later
- **Uncertain environments**: Don't know what users need
- **Risk-averse**: Validate before committing
- **Long-term thinking**: Maintain optionality

## Decision Criteria

### Choose Path A (TTT-Core) if:

- ✅ **Conviction**: Thermodynamic argument is compelling
- ✅ **Long-term**: Willing to invest 2 years before value
- ✅ **Hardware**: Neural co-evolution is critical goal
- ✅ **Verification**: Single bedrock is essential
- ✅ **Resources**: Can afford upfront investment

### Choose Path B (Theory-Agnostic) if:

- ✅ **Pragmatic**: Need value in 3-6 months
- ✅ **Ecosystem**: Integration with mathlib4/Coq essential
- ✅ **Flexible**: Different problems need different tools
- ✅ **Market**: Users will guide requirements
- ✅ **Skeptical**: Thermodynamic argument unproven

### Choose Path C (Hybrid) if:

- ✅ **Uncertain**: Don't know if TTT is worthwhile yet
- ✅ **Risk-averse**: Want to validate before committing
- ✅ **Pragmatic**: Need near-term value
- ✅ **Visionary**: Want long-term optionality
- ✅ **Resourced**: Can research + build in parallel

---

## Recommendation

**Path C (Hybrid)** is recommended because:

1. **Delivers value immediately** (theory-agnostic Phase 1)
2. **Validates assumptions** (TTT research Phase 2)
3. **Maintains optionality** (integrate TTT only if warranted)
4. **Mitigates risk** (no sunk cost if TTT fails)
5. **Gathers real data** (market tells you what's valuable)

**Key insight**: The TTT question is load-bearing for long-term vision, but doesn't need to be answered before shipping. Build, learn, decide.

---

## Dependencies Between Architectures

### Can transition:
- **B → C**: Add TTT research to theory-agnostic system ✅
- **B → A**: Replace backends with TTT core (hard) ⚠️
- **C → A**: Complete TTT integration ✅
- **C → B**: Stay theory-agnostic ✅

### Cannot transition easily:
- **A → B**: Hard to un-commit from TTT core ❌
- **A → C**: Can't go back to pre-TTT ❌

**This asymmetry favors starting with B or C** - you can always add TTT later, but it's hard to remove it.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Is there a middle ground between TTT and full theories?**
   - Could we have a "small" core that's not quite minimal but still optimizable?

2. **Can we get thermodynamic benefits without TTT?**
   - Direct SCTT → neural hardware compilation?

3. **Do users actually care about verification bedrock?**
   - Or is "verified in some theory" good enough?

4. **Is hardware co-evolution realistic for a small project?**
   - Can ProveIt actually influence Apple/NVIDIA?

5. **What's the right abstraction level for the backend interface?**
   - Too abstract → poor performance
   - Too concrete → not flexible enough
