## The Opportunity: Verified Neural Computation

### Current State (Unverified)

**Apple Developer**:
```swift
// Train neural network
let model = try MLModel(contentsOf: modelURL)

// Deploy to Neural Engine - hope it works
let prediction = try model.prediction(from: input)
```

**Problem**: No guarantees about correctness, safety, or behavior.

**NVIDIA Developer**:
```cuda
// Write neural shader
__global__ void neural_render(float* output, float* weights) {
    // Tensor operations - hope they're correct
    tensorcore_multiply(weights, input, output);
}
```

**Problem**: Shader bugs can cause visual artifacts, crashes, or worse.

### With TTT (Verified)

**Hypothetical ProveIt + TTT**:
```proveit
// Define neural operation in TTT
neural_shader :: Tensor -> Tensor -> Tensor
neural_shader weights input =
  proof_of_correctness: forall w i.
    bounded(output) && no_nan(output) && deterministic(output)

// Compile to Metal/CUDA with verification
metal_output = compile_to_metal(neural_shader)  // Proved correct
cuda_output = compile_to_cuda(neural_shader)    // Proved correct
```

**Guarantee**: If it compiles, it's provably correct.

## Why TTT Could Be "Native Language"

### 1. Tensor Operations Are Primitive

**Neural accelerators fundamentally compute**:
- Matrix multiplication
- Convolution
- Element-wise operations
- Reductions (sum, max, etc.)

**TTT could be designed** where these are primitive operations:
- Not encoded indirectly
- Direct hardware mapping
- Minimal translation overhead

### 2. Type Theory Matches Tensor Types

**Tensor programming needs**:
- Shape tracking (dimensions must match)
- Type safety (no shape mismatches)
- Correctness (no out-of-bounds)

**Dependent types naturally express**:
```
Matrix : Nat -> Nat -> Type
mult : Matrix m n -> Matrix n p -> Matrix m p  // Types enforce shape compatibility
```

**TTT could make this minimal** - basic dependent types for tensor safety.

### 3. Thermodynamic Alignment

**Neural accelerators exist because**:
- Special-purpose hardware is more energy-efficient
- Tensor operations are more efficient on dedicated hardware
- Market pressure drove hardware specialization

**TTT extends this**:
- Special-purpose type theory for verification
- Minimal operations = minimal energy
- Same thermodynamic pressure that created neural hardware

### 4. Compilation Target

**Metal 4 Tensor APIs**:
```metal
// Metal function for tensor multiplication
kernel void tensor_mult(
    device const float* A [[buffer(0)]],
    device const float* B [[buffer(1)]],
    device float* C [[buffer(2)]],
    uint2 gid [[thread_position_in_grid]])
{
    // Low-level tensor operations
}
```

**TTT compiler could generate**:
- Proved-correct Metal kernels
- Optimal instruction sequence
- Guaranteed memory safety
- No race conditions

**CUDA Tensor Core APIs**:
```cuda
// CUDA function for tensor core
__global__ void wmma_kernel(half *a, half *b, float *c) {
    wmma::fragment<...> a_frag, b_frag, c_frag;
    wmma::load_matrix_sync(a_frag, a, ...);
    wmma::load_matrix_sync(b_frag, b, ...);
    wmma::mma_sync(c_frag, a_frag, b_frag, c_frag);
    wmma::store_matrix_sync(c, c_frag, ...);
}
```

**TTT compiler could ensure**:
- Fragment sizes match
- Memory access patterns correct
- Synchronization proper
- Results guaranteed

## Killer Applications
