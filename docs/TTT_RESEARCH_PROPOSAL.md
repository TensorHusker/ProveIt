# Tiny Type Theory (TTT) Research Proposal

**The Foundational Question for ProveIt**

---

## Executive Summary

ProveIt faces a critical architectural decision: Should it have **Tiny Type Theory (TTT)** as a minimal computational core, or should it be **theory-agnostic** with pluggable mathematical backends?

This document outlines the research needed to make an informed decision, the criteria for choosing a path, and a staged implementation approach that doesn't block on the answer.

**Recommendation**: Build theory-agnostic ProveIt with current SCTT while researching TTT in parallel. Let market demand and technical validation guide the final architecture.

## The Core Question

### What is TTT?

**Tiny Type Theory** would be:
- The **minimal** dependent type theory capable of expressing all computation
- Optimized for **thermodynamic efficiency** (minimal operations = minimal energy)
- Designed to compile directly to **neural hardware** (Apple M5, NVIDIA RTX Tensor Cores)
- The **verified substrate** - everything else compiles to TTT with correctness guarantees

### Why It Matters

The choice between TTT-core and theory-agnostic affects:
1. **Hardware co-evolution** - Do we enable specialized neural-typed chips?
2. **Verification strategy** - One bedrock to verify vs. multiple backends
3. **Economic model** - Common substrate for pricing proofs (Libertalia)
4. **Thermodynamic advantage** - Minimal computation wins over time
5. **Catastrophic failure prevention** - Smallest attack surface

---

## The Case FOR TTT as Minimal Core

### 1. Thermodynamic Optimality

**Thesis**: Physical laws favor minimal computation.

**Argument**:
- Every computational operation consumes energy
- Simpler operations consume less energy per computation
- Over time, market pressure favors energy-efficient systems
- TTT provides competitive advantage through physics, not just design

**Evidence Needed**:
- Benchmark energy consumption: TTT vs. full SCTT vs. CIC
- Measure translation overhead: High-level theory → TTT
- Calculate thermodynamic payoff: Does energy savings exceed translation cost?

### 2. Hardware Co-Evolution

**Thesis**: Neural accelerators are already here and need a verified programming model.

**Current Reality**:
- **Apple M5** (shipping now): Neural Accelerator in each GPU core, 16-core Neural Engine, Metal 4 Tensor APIs
- **NVIDIA RTX 50** (shipping now): 5th-gen Tensor Cores, RTX Neural Shaders, DLSS 4 transformers
- **Millions of devices** with neural hardware, no formal verification

**Opportunity**:
- TTT could be the **native language** for tensor operations
- First formally verified programming environment for neural accelerators
- Compile TTT → Metal Tensor APIs, CUDA Tensor Cores
- Market exists NOW, not hypothetical future

**Evidence Needed**:
- Can TTT operations map efficiently to tensor operations?
- Prototype: Compile simple TTT programs to Metal/CUDA
- Benchmark: Is verified neural code competitive with unverified?

### 3. Formal Verification Bedrock

**Thesis**: Without a minimal core, verification has infinite regress.

**The Problem**:
- ProveIt verifies proofs in multiple theories
- But who verifies ProveIt itself?
- If there's no common core, each backend is a separate trust assumption

**With TTT**:
- Prove TTT's metatheory correct (once)
- All other theories compile to TTT
- If TTT is correct and compilation is verified, everything is correct
- Reduces trust base to minimal substrate

**Evidence Needed**:
- Can TTT's metatheory be proven correct in reasonable time?
- Can we build verified compilers: SCTT → TTT, CIC → TTT?
- Does this actually reduce attack surface vs. theory-agnostic?

### 4. Compositional Economics

**Thesis**: Libertalia (proof marketplace) needs common measure of computational cost.

**Why It Matters**:
- Users want to price and trade proofs
- Different theories have different computational costs
- How do you compare price of SCTT proof vs. CIC proof?

**With TTT**:
- Every proof ultimately compiles to TTT operations
- TTT operations have measured energy/time cost
- Market can price based on real computational resources
- Creates pressure for efficient encodings

**Evidence Needed**:
- Can we accurately measure TTT operation costs?
- Do users care about computational cost pricing?
- Is translation overhead too variable to make pricing meaningful?

### 5. Catastrophic Failure Prevention

**Thesis**: Minimal systems have fewer failure modes.

**Argument**:
- Complex software fails in complex ways
- More code = more bugs
- TTT has minimal code, minimal operations
- Bugs can only exist in translation layers, not core

**Evidence Needed**:
- Historical analysis: Do minimal cores actually fail less?
- Compare attack surface: TTT-core vs. multiple backends
- Security audit feasibility: One small core vs. many large backends

---

## The Case AGAINST TTT (Theory-Agnostic)

### 1. Maximum Flexibility

**Thesis**: Different mathematical domains need different foundations.

**Examples**:
- **Smooth mathematics** (differential geometry): Naturally fits smooth cubical types
- **Discrete mathematics** (graph theory): Naturally fits combinatorial types
- **Classical mathematics** (analysis): Naturally fits classical logic (CIC)
- **Constructive mathematics**: Naturally fits Martin-Löf Type Theory

**Problem with TTT**:
- Forcing everything through minimal discrete core may be inefficient
- Translation overhead could exceed thermodynamic savings
- Some structures don't encode naturally into TTT

### 2. Pragmatic Adoption

**Thesis**: Integration with existing ecosystems matters more than purity.

**Reality**:
- **Lean** has mathlib4 (1M+ lines of formalized mathematics)
- **Coq** has massive ecosystem
- **Agda**, **Isabelle**, etc. all have communities
- Forcing translation to TTT alienates these communities

**With Theory-Agnostic**:
- Work directly with Lean/CIC
- Import mathlib4 proofs without translation
- ProveIt becomes universal frontend, not competing foundation

### 3. No Universal Optimum

**Thesis**: There may not be a single "best" foundation for all problems.

**Argument**:
- Physics has multiple formalisms (Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, path integrals)
- Mathematics has multiple foundations (set theory, type theory, category theory)
- Forcing unity may be premature

**Evidence**:
- Some problems genuinely require continuous mathematics
- Some require discrete
- Hybrid problems might need multiple theories simultaneously

### 4. Translation Overhead

**Thesis**: Compiling to TTT might negate thermodynamic advantage.

**Risk**:
- SCTT → TTT: Smooth paths discretized, information lost, recovery expensive
- CIC → TTT: Classical reasoning compiled to constructive, proof blowup
- Every operation pays translation tax

**Evidence Needed**:
- Measure translation overhead for real problems
- Calculate break-even: When does thermodynamic savings exceed translation cost?

**6 Months**: Answer Questions 4-5 (hardware, market)
**Decision Point**: Go/No-Go on TTT based on evidence

---

## Recommended Approach: Staged Implementation

### Phase 0: Research (0-6 months, parallel with Phase 1)

**Don't block on TTT - build theory-agnostic ProveIt first.**

**Research activities:**
- Design TTT specification
- Test discrete encodings in SCTT
- Prototype SCTT → TTT compiler
- Benchmark neural accelerator integration
- Market research on verified neural compute

**Deliverables:**
- TTT formal specification
- Compilation prototype
- Performance benchmarks
- Market analysis report
- Go/No-Go decision

### Phase 1: Theory-Agnostic ProveIt (0-6 months)

**Build on current SCTT foundation:**
- Keep existing SCTT implementation
- Add backend interface layer
- Add Lean/CIC backend (mathlib4 compatibility)
- Validate architecture with multiple theories
- Ship to users, gather data

**Why first:**
- Pragmatic - works with existing ecosystems
- Fast to market
- Validates core value (visual manipulation)
- Generates revenue (Libertalia)
- Provides real usage data to inform TTT decision

### Phase 2: Decision & Implementation (6-12 months)

**If TTT validation succeeds:**
- TTT becomes additional backend in ProveIt
- Build verified compilers from other theories
- Target Metal/CUDA for neural hardware
- Maintain theory-agnostic architecture (TTT is option, not requirement)

**If TTT validation fails:**
- Continue with theory-agnostic architecture
- Optimize existing backends (SCTT, CIC)
- Focus on translation layers between theories
- Explore direct neural hardware targeting from SCTT

### Phase 3: Evolution (12+ months)

**Let market decide:**
- Do users pay premium for TTT-verified code?
- Does neural hardware performance justify adoption?
- Do hardware vendors optimize for TTT?
- Natural co-evolution based on real usage

## Risk Analysis

### Risks of Committing to TTT Too Early

1. **Sunk cost fallacy**: Invest 1-2 years before discovering inefficiency
2. **Market mismatch**: Build for use case that doesn't exist
3. **Translation complexity**: Underestimate difficulty of theory → TTT compilers
4. **Opportunity cost**: Miss near-term value from theory-agnostic approach

### Risks of Not Building TTT

1. **Thermodynamic disadvantage**: Competitors with minimal core are more efficient
2. **Hardware co-evolution**: Miss window for influencing neural accelerator design
3. **Verification gap**: No bedrock for proving ProveIt itself correct
4. **Economic inefficiency**: Can't price proofs accurately without common substrate

### Mitigation Strategy

**Staged approach mitigates both:**
- Build theory-agnostic first → No sunk cost if TTT fails
- Research TTT in parallel → Don't miss co-evolution window
- Decision based on evidence → Not dogma
- Maintain optionality → TTT can be added later if valuable
