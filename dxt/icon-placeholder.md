# Icon Placeholder

The `icon.png` file should be created with the following specifications:

## Design Requirements

- **Size**: 512x512 pixels (will be scaled down as needed)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Modern, minimalist, mathematical

## Design Concept

The icon should represent ProveIt's core concepts:

1. **Geometric Element**: A simple geometric shape (triangle, polygon, or cube)
2. **Type Theory Symbol**: Lambda (λ) or Pi (Π) symbol
3. **Accessibility**: Clean, high-contrast design
4. **Color Palette**:
   - Primary: Teal (#4EC9B0) - represents Types
   - Accent: Purple (#C586C0) - represents Keywords
   - Background: Dark or transparent

## Suggested Designs

### Option 1: Geometric Lambda
- A lambda symbol (λ) formed by geometric lines/points
- Represents both type theory and geometric proofs
- Teal on dark background

### Option 2: Cubical Structure
- A wireframe cube representing cubical type theory
- With mathematical symbols at vertices
- Purple and teal gradient

### Option 3: Proof Triangle
- A triangle with vertices labeled (assumption, implication, conclusion)
- Represents geometric proof construction
- Minimalist line art

## Creation

To create the icon:

1. Use a vector graphics tool (Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape)
2. Export as 512x512 PNG
3. Name it `icon.png`
4. Place in the `dxt/` directory

## Temporary Solution

Until a custom icon is created, you can use a placeholder:
- A solid teal square with a white λ symbol
- Or reference an existing mathematical symbol icon
